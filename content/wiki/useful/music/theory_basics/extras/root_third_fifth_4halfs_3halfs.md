title: '"Root, third, fifth" vs "4 half steps, 3 half steps" rules for chords'

If you're reading this, you probably have the same question I had before writing this page:

> To create a triad, we use the "root, third, and fifth" rule, right? But I've also learned that a major chord is composed by taking a root note, going up 4 half steps, taking that note, going up 3 half steps, and taking that note. Which means that "root, third, fifth" doesn't mean root, 3 half steps from the root and five half steps from the root. What's up with that confusion?

And now I have an answer to this question! The difference between these two rules is that one uses half steps as units, and the other one uses **intervals** as units.

## Understanding the units

The "root, third, fifth" rule actually means "root note, note that is a third interval above root, note that is a fifth interval above root".

## Why intervals?

Why does this unit exists? Because the "root, third, fifth" rule, also known as a triad, doesn't only apply to major chords. You can also create minor chords with triads, but minor chords don't use the same amount of half steps for an interval as major chords.

Here's a "visualization" of intervals for different chord types:

- Unison (same note): 0 half steps
- Minor Second: 1 half step
- Major Second: 2 half steps
- Minor Third: 3 half steps
- Major Third: 4 half steps
- Perfect Fourth: 5 half steps
- Diminished Fifth (Tritone): 6 half steps
- Perfect Fifth: 7 half steps
- Minor Sixth: 8 half steps
- Major Sixth: 9 half steps
- Minor Seventh: 10 half steps
- Major Seventh: 11 half steps
- Octave: 12 half steps

As you can see, a major third is 4 half steps, and a perfect fifth is 7 half steps (7 half steps = 3 half steps above the 4th half step).

Everything makes sense now!
