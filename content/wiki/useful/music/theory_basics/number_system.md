Using the C major scale as an example, if we apply the triad to each note of the scale, we get:

- A major chord
- A minor chord
- A minor chord
- A major chord
- A major chord
- A minor chord
- A diminished chord (we don't care about this one)

A common shorthand is writing these down using roman numerals:

- I
- ii
- iii
- IV
- V
- vi

The number represets the degree of the scale where you apply the triad, and the capitals indicate major chords.

By using numbers instead of letters names for chords, we can easily use a chord in any key we want, by thinking of them as scale degrees instead of specific notes that should be played.
