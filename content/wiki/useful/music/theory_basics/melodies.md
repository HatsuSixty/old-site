## Understanding the concept

Melodies are single sequences of notes played with chords, usually above them.

In a song, this is usually the thing you would sing along to. Even in instrumental music there's usually some kind of lead melodic part that's the most interesting and the most memorable.

## Creating melodies

Considering you've read the previous pages on music theory in my website, you already have all of the raw ingredients to create a melody. You can just start stringing together notes that are in the key that you're in on the top of a chord progression.

But there's a really interesting relationship between what notes you're playing over which chord. A lot of that has to do with whether or not a note in your melody is a note in your chord.

### Relations between melodies and chords (and tips on creating melodies)

Melodies that only use the notes in the chord are usually pretty bland, so it tends to be more interesting to use some notes that are *outside* the chord. Tipically these are passing notes, so notes that are in between two notes that are in the chord.

One thing that is good to know is that often a melody will end in a note that's within the chord, rather than ending with a note that is not in the chord.

Another little shortcut to creating melodies that mostly sound good is using the major pentatonic scale. You can get a major pentatonic scale by removing the fourth and seventh degrees of a scale. For example: C major (C D E F G A B) would turn into just C D E G A. Playing melodies with notes from C major pentatonic over chords from C major will tipically sound pretty good.
