## Understanding the concept

An inversion is when you change the positions of the notes in a chord so that the root is no longer the lowest.

For example, C major is C E G, but we can also use E G C, or G C E. It will be the same chord, but the root is no longer the lowest note in the chord.

This is useful because for chord progressions, it often sounds better to find inversions where the notes are closer to each other, rather than moving the triad shape like we learned before.

## Adding more notes

Another thing about inversions is that they can change the flavor of a chord. And you can reinforce that by playing the lowest note of the chord in lower octaves. In a piano, you would do that by playing the chords with one of your hands, and playing the lowest note of the chord in lower octaves using another hand.
