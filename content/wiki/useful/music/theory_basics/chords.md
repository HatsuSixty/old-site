## Chords

Chords are multiple notes played at the same time. The chords in a song do the work of setting the emotion of the song.

Since chords are made up of notes, and notes are in keys, chords are almost always in the same key. If you play a bunch of notes from C major, you're playing some kind of chord from C major.

## Forming chords in C major

The most common chords contain three notes that have a specific relationship to each other, and we call that relationship the **"root, third, and fifth"**. In a chord of C major, we can play the root of C major, the third of C major (E), and the fifth of C major (G), at the same time, and that gives us the chord of C major.

**You can think of this as playing the first degree of C major, skipping one, playing the next one, skipping one, and playing the next one again, at the same time.**

This kind of chord is also called a **triad**.

### Forming more chords

We can take the triad shape, move the root in a way that it's still any other note from C major, and we will get another chord from C major.

For example, a chord in C major that starts from F, will have the notes F, A and C. 

Also, now that we're talking about the F chord, we need to start understanding a bit more the terms used, because the root of an F chord is F, the third is A, and the fifth is C, but we're still in the key of C major where C is the root, and F is the fourth in relation to C, and A is the sixth in relation to C, and so on.

## Chord types: Major and Minor

There are two common types of chord in music: major and minor. And there's a very specific relationship that makes up these chords:

If we look at the C E G chord, for example, it is a *major* chord. If we look at the spacing between these notes, we will notice that E is 4 half steps ahead of C, and G is 3 half steps ahead of E. And that's the formula of a **major triad**.

Similarly to a major triad, we get a **minor triad** if we use 3 half steps and 4 half steps instead. Using the minor triad instead of a major triad in the chord we used as an example, we get C Eâ™­ G, a minor chord.

Also, we can create a diminished triad by using 3 half steps between each note. We're not gonna get into it right now because it is much more rarely used than major and minor chords.

    <b style="color: var(--rly-hard-to-ignore);">IMPORTANT:</b> While writing this page, I noticed that saying that the "root, third, and fifth" rule and the "4 half steps, 3 half steps" rule both generate major chords can be quite confusing, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgaTLrZGlk0">video</a> doesn't explain it very well.
