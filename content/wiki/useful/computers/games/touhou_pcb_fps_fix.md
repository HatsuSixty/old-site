An easy way to fix PCB's FPS is using VPatch, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.mediafire.com/download/n7va6o67cyamani/VsyncPatch.zip).

# How to

With VPatch extracted, find and copy the files `vpatch.exe`, `vpatch.ini` and `vpatch_th07.dll` inside the zip's `vpatch_rev4` folder to your game's folder.

Now you can launch the game by running `vpatch.exe`!

If you use an english patch, then rename the original game executable (`th07.exe`) to something else, and rename `th07e.exe` to `th07.exe`.
