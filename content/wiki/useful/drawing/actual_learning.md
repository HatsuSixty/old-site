This is an update to the old posts I wrote on drawing. After a few months of drawing almost everyday, I don't necessarily agree with a lot of the stuff I wrote on that topic in the past, so here's my updated view on how you should learn to draw.

## Your Motivation

I'll first let a really important thing out of the way: you **need** to have fun while learning! This isn't just true at the beginning or when you're advanced: you need to enjoy the **whole** process. If you don't do that you'll quickly give up because you won't have motivation to draw, because you're not having fun. Your brain will think it's not worth it.

## My Recommended Roadmap

Before I get into the roadmap, please keep in mind that you'll have to practice a lot. Most of what you learn will come from your practice sessions.

### Beginning

In the beginning, I would recommend you to start drawing anything you like, keeping in mind that your first drawing will likely not result as you expect. You can then search online how to deal with your specific struggles. For example: if you try to draw a character, and you think the character's head didn't turn out looking that great, you can search for an YouTube tutorial on how to draw heads, and try again.

Also, you don't have to watch/listen/read drawing content only when you're practicing. You can do it for fun in your spare time! And I actually recommend that.

Alongside that, you should also be learning the basics: how to draw lines, how to draw shapes, how to draw perspective, etc. One really important thing you should keep in mind in that stage: you absolutely **shouldn't** ignore the "alongside that" part. When you're in the stage of learning the basics, you should still be drawing what you like and enjoy the process.

### Moving On

Once you have learned the basic concepts needed for drawing the stuff you like, you should already have a rough idea on what you need to get better at. For example: if you're learning character drawing, at this stage you should probably already know that you need to get better at drawing anatomy, for example.

From there, you can keep watching/listening/reading drawing content on what you're interested in, and enjoy drawing as you apply your newly-acquired knowledge to your art.

And again, you don't have to watch/listen/read drawing content only when you're practicing. You can do it for fun in your spare time.
