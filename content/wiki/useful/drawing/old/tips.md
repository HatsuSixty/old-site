In this page I will be showing some drawing tips I learned while studying character drawing, in no particular ordering.

This is **not** meant for absolute beginners that are drawing for the first time. You must at least know a bit about character drawing before making use of these tips.

Also, most of these tips are focused on character drawing, though they might also be useful for people drawing other kind of stuff.

# 1: Copying > Tracing

Mindlessly tracing artworks/reference images will not help you improve your drawing skills.

On the other hand, if you try to copy an artwork as best as you can, by trying to replicate it, you will get more familiar with the shapes and other elements that make up a good artwork.

Though if you pay attention to what you're drawing while you trace something, you can improve your drawing skills, but I still wouldn't recommend it.

# 2: Use a reasonable resolution for your canvas

While drawing I noticed that canvas with resolutions below 3000x3000 are very hard to draw on, because when you try to add very small details, you end up working at pixel level.

I personally like to use 4000x4000 when drawing.

# 3: Observation

You've probably heard about that before, but I'm not talking about only observing other artworks, I'm talking about observing everything, including real life.

When you look at something, try to imagine the shapes that make up that thing.

Doing that, even for brief moments, can help you level up your drawing skills.

# 4: Watch people draw!

Watch art content creators, not only is it fun, but you can also learn something from it!.

# 5: Think in 3D

You're not drawing in 2D. When drawing a character in perspective, for example, one leg can be in front of another, things can get smaller the further they are to from the camera, etc.

Always keep that in mind when drawing.

# 6: Study only the stuff you will actually use

This one is self-explanatory. If you're focused on character drawing, learning other things like designing backgrounds might not be that useful for you.

**That's it! I hope someone finds this information useful.**
