**This content is outdated.** [Actually Learning How to Draw]({{< relref "../actual_learning.md" >}}) may be of your interest.

Please keep in mind that when I was writing those pages, I was still learning drawing, so unless explicitly noted, the pages under this category are basically "notes" I took while learning.

## Pages

- [How to learn drawing?]({{< relref "learn.md" >}})
- [Drawing Tips]({{< relref "tips.md" >}})
