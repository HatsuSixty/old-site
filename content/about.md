(originally created December 27 2023, rewritten from scratch August 22 2024)

Hi, I'm a transgender girl ![Trans Flag Emoji](/trans-flag-emoji.png) that enjoys creating stuff!

You can call me Hatsu, Amanda, Ammy, or whatever variations of my name you can think of (as long as I don't find it ugly).

Below are some things about me, if you're interested.

## Programming

I like programming and computers in general. I consider myself pretty good at programming actually. I'm more interested in systems programming and low level stuff, but I really like programming in general!

## Software

I generally prefer to use open source software, but I don't mind having to use proprietary software if I need to. For example, I like to use Linux on my computers, but I won't find it annoying if I have to work with other operating systems if I have to.

## Drawing

I also like to draw! I don't really post my art online, primarily because I don't think it's good enough to show it online. Sometimes I end up sharing some of my drawings though.

## Games

The first game I've really gotten into was Minecraft, so it's naturally one of my favorite games, even though I don't play it very often anymore.

Other games I really like are Undertale and Deltarune. These two games are amazing and they are a big inspiration for my game projects.

Speaking of big inspirations, I REALLY like the Touhou Project series. Like, a lot. I'm not good at the games, but the characters, story and music are simply one of the biggest, if not the biggest, inspiration for my future game projects.

## Future game projects?

Yeah. I can't say much about it. Just know that I have pretty big plans about this thing :3

## Anime

I don't really watch anime anymore, but I used to do it a lot.

My favorite anime is JoJo's Bizarre Adventures. It is the first anime I've really gotten into, so it is really special for me.

But the actual first anime I've ever watched was Kaguya-sama: Love is War. Can't say much about it other than it's a really interesting anime, and I really recommend checking it out!

Also, I couldn't talk about anime without talking about Re:Zero. I haven't seen enough of it to consider it my favorite anime, but it's definitely at least my second favorite. Something about it just plays with my emotions in a special way. Don't know how to really describe it. I just recommend watching.

Nowadays I have a lot of hobbies, and among them, watching anime does not appeal that much, so I just stopped watching anime. I kinda plan to get back into it though.

## Manga

I've only ever finished one manga, that being Yagate Kimi ni Naru. It's a really nice Yuri romance, really recommend it!

## AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

Purple and pink are my favorite colors. These are just the prettiest ones. Period.
